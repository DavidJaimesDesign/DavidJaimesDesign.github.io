            I have a hodgepodge of experience in the backend. I know Ruby and a tad bit of Rails. I have some experience with SQL dbs mostly running queries from the commandline. That is why I am jumping intot the backend portion of FCC since the data viz sectio does not offer much in terms of guides, and I am not worthy yet.

         	This course is great! So much better then learnyounode, since you are actually building something and there are code examples. The quizes are ok. What I like to do is if the lecture is covering something that is hard for me to grasp I will pull up the example code and copy it line by line. At least for me it helps me understand what is going on when I slow down and work on the code line by line. The homework is just tough enough where you have to think, but not have to slam your head on the keyboard. I really like it and would recomend to anyone tacklin the BackEnd cert.
